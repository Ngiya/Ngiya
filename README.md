- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ngiya
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in graphic design (mostly UI and UX related) using photoshop and illustrator and video creation or animation using AE or FCPX (but not as much because of that new mobile app, Alight Motion (basically made me uninterested in video creation)).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code :)
